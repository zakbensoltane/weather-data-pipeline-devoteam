# weather-data-pipeline-devoteam
Built an automated weather data pipeline using Python, Airflow, and Docker to ingest, transform, and store data in PostgreSQL. Developed an XGBoost model to predict rainfall. This internship at Devoteam strengthened my skills in data engineering and machine learning in a real-world setting.
